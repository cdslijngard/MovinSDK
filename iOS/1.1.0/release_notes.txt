 * Improved stability;
 * Developers are free to choose what kind of location usage is needed, the SDK supports both "Always" and "When in use"
 	The message shown is based on the property set in the apps info.plist file (NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription vs NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription)
 
Changes:
 * For initialization a MapID is mandatory;
 * HTTP requests are updated to be conform the current server version.
 
Bug fixes:
 * None
 
Known issues:
 * Bitcode has not yet been generated for the library, apps using this library should disable bitcode in the build settings
 * The server does not support valid HTTPS requests yet, so this needs to be addressed in iOS 9 apps. (See this SO article: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30731785/how-do-i-load-an-http-url-with-app-transport-security-enabled-in-ios-9)
